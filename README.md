# CSGO KZ Multiscript
A small weekend project of mine 
(since I had no prior knowledge of coding macro scripts feel free to make improvements)

Instructions:
1. Download AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Run CSGO
3. Start Ahkhider.ahk
4. Start LegitStrafe.ahk or Bhop.ahk

keybinds:
hold "space" for bunnyhop
hold "mouse4" for autostrafe

infos:
Please note that this script was all about functionality not undetectablitiy, i don't take any responsibility should a ban occur. 
Some KZ servers have their own anti scripting measures, test with a vpn first!

Disclaimer: The AhkHider is not made by me, just minor optimization for my script, its published here so you dont have to do a seperate search.
(The original creator is named down below and in the code!)
